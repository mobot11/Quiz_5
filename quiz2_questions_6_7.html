<!--question 6 For these last two questions, you're going to create a website that displays a random string when you click a button. (You'll be using the function you just wrote above to generate that random string.) Use jQuery to do this.

In this question, submit the html for this website. I recommend writing it in Sublime (or whatever your text editor of choice is), and then copying and pasting it here. Save that file - you'll need it later!

Alternatively, create a new repo for your code and upload it to GitHub. Paste the repo link here.*/-->

  <title>random string generator</title>

<button id="randomButton">click here to generate a random string></button>

<!--/*Question 7 In this question, copy and paste in the contents of your JavaScript file for your random string generator site.




Again, be sure to create this code in a sublime file that you save for later use.

var randomArray = ['dog', 'cat', 'pig', 'hamster', 'human'];

  var randomStringSelector = function (stringArray) {
    return stringArray[Math.floor(Math.random() * stringArray.length)];
  }

  ("#randomButton").on("click", randomStringSelector(randomArray));
